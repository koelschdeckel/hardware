= Introducation

^^dkl is an Open Source hardware project that is being developed in
cooperation between the City of Cologne and Press Any Key UG. The
platform is intended to bridge the gap between devices similar to
Arduino, which allow physical access to sensors via electronic protocols
and device like Raspberry Pi that allow comfortable programming and
access to higher level facilities like Ethernet, USB and Bluetooth at
the cost of system complexity.

The system is intended to be used with applications that require
immediate interaction with the physical world, but need to interact with
the Internet or user devices. Furthermore, technical expertise required
to customise and operate the platform should be reduced to a minimum.
